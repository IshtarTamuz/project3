        <p>The group coaching process has seven steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the case-giver and the time keeper</li>
            <li>Intention statement by the case-giver</li>
            <li>Stillness and deep listening</li>

            <li>Closing remarks</li>
            <li>Journaling</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To get a full understanding of each of these steps watch this video.</p>
        <video controls width="500">

        </video>
        <p class="note"> <em>This video was produced by Bassel Martin for the eLearning Tools course (SE-DEV101)
                assignment</em> </p>
        <h2>Focus point 1: How to make a strong intention statement</h2>
        <p>As you learned from the video, the case-giver is the person who shares a problem or a challenge they would
            like help with from the group . To present the case with clarity, answer the following five questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is my key challenge or problem I'm trying to solve?</li>
            <li>Who else is affected by this challenge?</li>
            <li>What is the future that I'm trying to create?</li>
            <li>What do I need to let go of, and what do I need to learn?</li>
            <li>What do I need help with?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Focus point 2: How to practice deep listening</h2>
        <p>Deep listening means listening with all of our senses. Specifically, it means that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You are asking yourself, "what do I hear," "what do I feel," and "what are the sensations that are going
                through my body while I'm receicing the information?</li>
            <li>You are focusing on what trully resonates with you. What metaphors and images does the information
                evoque?
            </li>
            <li>You share your feelings, the metaphors and images that came up. </li>
            <li>You resist the temptation to give advice or to try to solve the case-giver's problem.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Live practice schedule</h2>
        <p>There are six live online practice slots. Make sure to participate in at least one. Book your calendar.</p>
